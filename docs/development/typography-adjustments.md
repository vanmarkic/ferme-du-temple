# Typography Size Adjustments

## Change Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12

### Issue
Initial typography implementation felt too large on desktop screens.

### Solution
Following typography best practices, we adjusted the **desktop base font size** from 18px to 17px.

This is the recommended approach from the typography guidelines because:
- ✅ Simpler than changing the scale factor
- ✅ Only requires updating two rem values
- ✅ Maintains the harmonious Major Third (1.25) type scale
- ✅ Keeps mobile at comfortable 16px

### Changes Made

#### Before
- Mobile: 16px base
- Desktop: 18px base (felt too large)

#### After
- Mobile: 16px base
- Desktop: 17px base (more comfortable)

### Files Modified

1. **[src/index.css](../../src/index.css#L155-L160)** - Body base font size
   ```css
   @media (min-width: 768px) {
     body {
       font-size: 1.0625rem; /* 17px for desktop */
     }
   }
   ```

2. **[src/index.css](../../src/index.css#L238-L242)** - `.text-body` utility class
   ```css
   @media (min-width: 768px) {
     .text-body {
       font-size: 1.0625rem; /* 17px for desktop */
     }
   }
   ```

### Why This Approach?

From the typography principles document:

> **Two Methods for Responsive Typography:**
> 1. **Change base font size** (preferred for simpler CSS)
> 2. Change scale factor
>
> **Why Method 1 is preferred:** Only need to define two rem values for body text vs. defining two complete sets of heading sizes

### Alternative Options Not Used

#### Option 2: Change Scale Factor
We could have switched from Major Third (1.25) to Minor Third (1.2):
- ❌ More complex - requires redefining all heading sizes
- ❌ Affects proportions throughout the entire scale
- ❌ Would need to update Tailwind config extensively

#### Option 3: Individual Adjustments
We could have adjusted individual text sizes:
- ❌ Breaks the mathematical harmony
- ❌ Creates inconsistent spacing relationships
- ❌ Harder to maintain

### Testing

✅ All tests passing (44/44)
✅ Build successful
✅ No breaking changes
✅ Maintains accessibility standards

### Current Font Sizes (Desktop)

| Class | Mobile | Desktop | Use Case |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| `text-xs` | ~13px | ~13px | Very small text |
| `text-sm` | 14px | 14px | Small text |
| `text-base` | 16px | **17px** | Body text |
| `text-lg` | 20px | 20px | Large body |
| `text-xl` | 25px | 25px | h5 |
| `text-2xl` | 31px | 31px | h4 |
| `text-3xl` | 39px | 39px | h3 |
| `text-4xl` | 49px | 49px | h2 |
| `text-5xl` | 61px | 61px | h1 |
| `text-6xl` | 76px | 76px | Display |
| `text-7xl` | 95px | 95px | Large Display |
| `text-8xl` | 119px | 119px | Hero |

Note: Only the `text-base` body size changes between mobile and desktop. All other sizes in the type scale remain consistent, which is why using rem units works so well - they scale proportionally based on the root font size.

### Further Adjustments

If text still feels too large, you can:

1. **Reduce desktop base further** (e.g., to 16.5px or 1.03125rem)
2. **Stay at 16px for both mobile and desktop** (removes double-stranded approach)
3. **Switch to Minor Third scale** (1.2 ratio instead of 1.25)

### Recommendation

The current setting (17px desktop) provides:
- ✅ Good readability
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Meets WCAG accessibility guidelines
- ✅ Comfortable for extended reading

Try this in the browser first before making further adjustments. Typography principles recommend trusting your eyes - guidelines are guidelines, not rules.

### Next Steps

If you want to make further adjustments:

```css
/* In src/index.css, line 157-159 */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 1.03125rem; /* 16.5px - even smaller */
    /* OR */
    font-size: 1rem; /* 16px - same as mobile */
  }
}
```

Remember to update the `.text-body` class as well (around line 239-241).
